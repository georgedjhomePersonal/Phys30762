Started by defining a functiion with just a for loop.

Figured out how to pass multiple inputs at once and how to use strings.

Then figured out if/else statements and had to change my inputs from a = b; to a{b}; after remembering what was said in prelecture videos and added the Bohr equation (had to correct it later on since n_f and n_i were the wrong way around).

Checked what would happen with erroneous inputs or wrong types/form and realised the program would loop endlessly.

Corrected this by searching online for how to check if inputs were inputed correctly and implemented this error handling. Then got confused about the cin.clear() and cin.ignore and had to research the purpose of these.

Finally, added a readMe.md
